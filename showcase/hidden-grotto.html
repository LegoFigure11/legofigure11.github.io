<div>
  This Hidden Grotto is home to Pok&eacute;mon that have been given to me by my friends, and hold a
  special place in my heart. They all have a deep sentimental value to me and I treasure them
  dearly. They are listed below in Pok&eacute;dex order. To see my other cherished Pok&eacute;mon,
  see my <a href="../showcase" class="text-decoration-none text-info">Showcase</a>.
