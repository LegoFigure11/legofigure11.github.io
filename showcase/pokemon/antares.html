    Jirachi has been one of my favourite Pok&eacute;mon ever since I discovered it in the back of a
    PRIMA guide in 2005, where its stats and movepool were blanked out because it was so mysterious.
    Since then I've managed to get my hands on a few from events in my childhood and even RNG&apos;d
    a shiny WISHMKR one, but with Channel being the &quot;final frontier&quot; of my GameCube
    RNG experience and the availability of far better shiny spreads, it only seemed fitting to get
    one from there as well.<br />
    <br />
    Antares is one half of a pair of CHANNEL Jirachi, his sister being a non-shiny 6IV spread named
    &quot;Alcyone&quot; gifted to <a class="text-decoration-none text-info" href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/members/550428/">kasib</a>.
    Both are named after stars (with thanks to kasib for inspiration) and are on their way to
    becoming fully-fledged Ribbon Masters in Gen 8.
