# Hi!
This site is pretty much what it says on the box: A dumping ground for my stuff.

If you're reading this then you're already at [home](), but you might want to check out some of the other pages hosted here.

### Tools
The [Tools index page](/tools) is a place where you can find all of the various scripts and programs that I've made. Some are better than others but to my knowledge they all work!

### Other stuff
The index of [Other Stuff](/stuff) is a place where you will find various tidbits of information or links to things that I find interesting. You may not always understand them but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ - they're here for a reason that means something to me.

### Info
My [Info page](/info) is where you'll find info about where to find me on the internet and the best ways to get in touch, if you need anything from me.

### Tunes
The [Tunes page](/tunes) is where you'll find my music dump - my tastes are a little different to what most people are used to, so check it out and maybe you'll find something new that you like!
