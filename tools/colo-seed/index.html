  Download the script below (Right-click <code>View Raw</code> and then <code>Save Link As...</code>),
  then open it up in the text editor of your choice and edit the paths on lines 8 and 9 to point to
  your own local copy of <code>RunAsDate.exe</code> and <code>Dolphin.exe</code>. Then save it and
  double-click that batch file to run! It&apos;ll prompt you to input a time and date (make sure you
  include the backslashes and colons as prompted) and the script will automatically boot Dolphin in
  developer mode at the time you requested.
  This is designed to work with Dolphin 4.0-6848 <span class="fw-bold">only</span>, you might
  experience unexpected results with other versions. Make sure you use 32&ndash;bit RunAsDate with
  32&ndash;bit Dolphin, or vice versa with 64&ndash;bit, or it won&apos;t work!
