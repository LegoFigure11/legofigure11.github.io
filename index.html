<h1>Lego's Stuff</h1>

<hr />
<h2>Hi! I&apos;m Lego.</h2>
This site houses a collection of tools, guides, and other goodies that I have made over the years.
It was originally created as a place for me to document stuff and organise my thoughts so that I
wouldn't forget it down the track, so there might be some stuff that doesn't completely make sense
to you. I&apos;m a big believer in FOSS and sharing knowledge with the masses though, so I've made
my tools and information here public!
<br />
<br />
This whole site is also open-source and on GitHub, so if you&apos;re reading this and notice a
mistake, or if you&apos;ve made something cool that you think belongs here, head on over and open
a pull request! You can view the source code for any page by using the &quot;Source code for this
page&quot; link in the footer. Please enjoy your stay!
