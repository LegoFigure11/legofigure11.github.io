<h1>Extracting Pok&eacute;mon from RAM in Colo/XD</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Preface</h2>
<div>
  <span class="fw-bold">You should never need this guide!</span> But here you are anyway... You most
  likely accidentally mismatched your savestate with the state of your memory card. You can prevent
  this from happening in a couple of ways &mdash; preferably, every time you save in game, you
  should &quot;update&quot; all of your save states &ndash; that is to say, overwrite
  <span class="fst-italic">all</span> of your save states to match wherever you just saved.
  Alternatively, if you need to be able to use a save state again, just back up the memory card
  and the save state file before saving the game again, and restore them whenever you need to re-use
  that specific save state.

    The first step is to load up your save state in Dolphin, and navigate to the Memory window. I'll
    be using Pok&eacute;mon XD for this and Dolphin 5.0-266, but the process is the same on every
    version that I&apos;ve encountered. You&apos;ll also want to right-click and <code>View as > ASCII</code>,
    so that it looks something like this:

    <img class="img-fluid" src="./memory-tab-open.png" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    Next, you need to put the PID of the Pok&eacute;mon that you want to dump into the box labelled
    <code>1</code> below, then hit the Search button labelled <code>2</code>, ensuring that Hex is
    checked below it and not ASCII. It should pop up with a message saying that a match was found,
    if it doesn't then try putting <code>80000000</code> into the box labelled <code>3</code> and
    searching again.

    <img class="img-fluid" src="./match-found.png" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    You might have to search a couple of times before you actually find your Pok&eacute;mon and not
    just random data in the RAM &mdash; you know you have the right thing when you can see your
    Pok&eacute;mon&apos;s nickname (in this case, &quot;Hunter&quot;) and OT name (in this case,
    &quot;Henry&quot;) in the data surrounding the PID, like so:

    <img class="img-fluid" src="./nickname-and-trainer-data.png" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    If it looks something like that, congrats! You&apos;ve found your Pok&eacute;mon. Now, it&apos;s
    time to fire up your Hex Editor, and load up the <code>blank.*k3</code> file you downloaded
    earlier. Navigate to the offset <code>0x28</code> (or, <code>0x04</code> if you&apos;re editing
    the Colo file). An easy way to tell the current offset in HxD is to look in the bottom left corner!

    <img class="img-fluid" src="./hxd.png" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    Ensuring you&apos;re in overwrite mode and not insert mode, enter your Pok&eacute;mon&apos;s PID
    at this offset as it appears in the Memory tab.

    <img class="img-fluid" src="./pid.png" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    Now, scrolling up and down in the Memory tab as necessary, enter the rest of the data into the
    hex editor, relative to the PID offset (everything before the PID goes before it, everything
    after goes after), until you have reached both the start and the end of the file in your hex
    editor. <span class="fw-bold">
      If at any point you edit the file size, you&apos;ve made a mistake!
    </span> Once finished, save the file. Load up your (working) save in PKHeX, and inject the .*k3
    file you just created in the hex editor into your save! Assuming you didn&apos;t make any
    mistakes, Congrats! You managed to rescue your Pok&eacute;mon from the save state. If you made
    any typos at all, however, your Pok&eacute;mon is unfortunately now edited, so make sure you
    double and triple check you copied the data from the Memory tab into the hex editor correctly!
